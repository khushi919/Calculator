# Calculator
It is a simple calculator having an aesthetic, cute and pleasing to see GUI.
Numbers don't really need to be clicked using the pointer but can also be clicked using the keyboard.
"Enter" button will give the final result; "Backspace" button will help delete one number at a time and the "ESC" button will clear anything that's entered.
